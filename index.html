    <section id="about">
            <p>I'm a data enthusiast with over 6 years of hands-on experience collecting and managing data in fast-paced, high-impact environments. From field operations to structured reports, I've worked closely with data where accuracy meant everything.</p>
        <p>That’s where my passion for data analysis began — not just gathering information, but understanding it. Today, I use tools like SQL, Python, and Excel to explore, clean, and visualize data in ways that reveal clear, actionable insights.</p>
        <p>My goal? To turn raw data into powerful stories that drive decisions and create real-world impact. This portfolio is a reflection of that journey — and the skills I’m building to take it even further.</p>

        <h3>Assessment Food Expenditure Among Syrian Refugees Households</h3>
        
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>The Syrian crisis, which began in 2011, led to the displacement of approximately 5.5 million refugees, severely impacting their ability to meet basic needs, especially food. Food is a fundamental pillar for every household, and factors such as low income, large family sizes, and limited government support have made it increasingly difficult to cover food expenditures. These challenges have significantly influenced food choices, with potential long-term effects on health and well-being. This project aims to analyze these factors and assess their impact on food expenditure patterns in refugee households, focusing on regions in <strong>Kurdistan, Iraq</strong>, and <strong>Jordan</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4>Business Impact</h4>
        <p>Uncovering these insights can drive meaningful action in several key areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supporting Host Countries:</strong> The data can assist host countries in identifying the most critical needs of refugees, enabling them to target food assistance more effectively and ensure that the most vulnerable households receive adequate support.</li>
            <li><strong>Helping Organizations Tackle Food Insecurity:</strong> Relevant organizations can leverage this data to develop strategies for addressing food insecurity, creating job opportunities for qualified refugees, and offering training programs for those not yet able to enter the labor market—aligning with the host country's regulations and economic landscape.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tools Used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Excel:</strong> Used for data cleaning, basic analysis, and organizing the dataset.</li>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> Utilized for advanced data analysis, statistical modeling, and creating predictive insights using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.</li>
            <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Created interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the findings and make the data insights easily accessible to stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
